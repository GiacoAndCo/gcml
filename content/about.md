I'm **Davide**, sometimes "jack", mostly "giaco". I spend my days doing what I love: building and destroying things, mostly in the cloud.

Most of my billed time is currently spent at [Datatellers], where I'm the *solution architect*. My focus is on the research & planning of our products, ranging from data platforms to autonomous robots.

I'm a huge unix nerd, and I design & build my own keyboards.

Some of my work is on [Github], DMs on [Twitter], emails *soon*.
