üìç Amsterdam

I'm **Davide**, sometimes "jack", mostly "giaco". I spend my days doing what I love: building and destroying things, sometimes with code, often in the cloud.

Currently spending my energies at [uButler], contributing to create the best relocation platform for ILHs in Europe.

Previously *solution architect* and *team lead* at [Datatellers]. 
My main focus was planning our products, ranging from data platforms to autonomous robots, together with R&D for agritech and healthtech projects, with contribuition at the Siena Artificial Intelligence hub ([SAIhub]).

I'm a huge unix nerd, and I design & build my own keyboards.

Some of my personal work is on [Github], DMs on [Twitter].
