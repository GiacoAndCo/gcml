üìç Siena

I'm **Davide**, sometimes "jack", mostly "giaco". I spend my days doing what I love: building and destroying things, often in the cloud.

Most of my billed time is currently spent at [Datatellers], where I'm the *solution architect*. My main focus is planning our products, ranging from data platforms to autonomous robots. Currently I'm spending my energies in R&D for agritech and healthtech projects, leading teams at the Siena Artificial Intelligence hub ([SAIhub])

I'm a huge unix nerd, and I design & build my own keyboards.

Some of my work is on [Github], DMs on [Twitter].
